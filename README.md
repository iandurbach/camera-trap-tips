# camera-trap-tips
This repo contains illustrations of various good and bad camera trapping practices, and cheatsheets for *secr* software. The intention is to add to these over time, the reality might be a bit different.  

1. *sampling-bias*: sampling favourable habitats biases density and abundance estimates up. 
2. *mesh-size*: too small a mesh biases density and abundance estimates up.
3. something on *trap-spacing* (to do).

Note to self: 1 + 2 are simulation-based illustrations, but use real camera trap locations that I'm not sure I can share (work done originally for Snow Leopard Trust). Need to find this out and either share or add made-up survey (11/19).
